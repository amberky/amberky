### Hello, I am Amber

I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for web development. 

- 📍 Based in Penang, Malaysia.
- 💻 I use `.ts`, `.html`, `.css`, `.py`
- 🌱 Exploring Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, and NgRx.
- 🏠 Working remotely suits me well, and I find that I am highly productive when working from home.
- 😆 Fun fact: I can happily stay at home alone for a month without needing to go out!

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you'd like to connect!
